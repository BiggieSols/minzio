<%= @from_user.name %> made you the admin for the group '<%= @group.name %>'! This means you can now do the following things:
1) remove group members
2) change the group name
3) delete the group
4) transfer admin privileges to another user

Remember - great power comes with great responsibility. Take good care of your group!

Cheers,
Sol from Minzio
